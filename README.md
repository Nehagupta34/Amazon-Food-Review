# Amazon-Food-Review
This project lays emphasis on the Amazon Food Review System where the food and services are reviewed. I have done this project with the help of geeks for geeks and kaggle and downloaded the dataset from kaggle.com. 
The dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all 500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories.
